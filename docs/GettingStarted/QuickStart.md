## Getting Started

1. Install Crowds from the Unity Asset Store.
2. Install the [required packages](../Requirements).
3. Follow the [How To: Create An Agent](../../HowTo/CreateAnAgent/) guide.
4. Add [steering actions](../SteeringBehaviours) to control the movement of the agent around the scene.
5. Add [sensors](../SteeringSensors) to avoid things in the scene.

## Basic Concepts

The **Getting Started** section of the docs explains the basic concepts of how Crowds works, what [Local Avoidance](../LocalAvoidance) is, how [Context Aware Steering Actions](../SteeringBehaviours) solve the pitfalls of traditional steering behaviours and how [Steering Sensors](../SteeringSensors) drive can inject gameplay into movement to create more intelligent behaviour.

## Demo Scenes

Crowds includes a number of demo scenes which introduce the basic concepts of the system and demostrate how to create some common scenarios. Get started with these demos by running the `Start Here` scene in the `Assets/Plugins/PlaceholderSoftware/Crowds/Demos` folder. If you're having trouble making an agent behave as you want in your scene try cloning the most similar demo scene and tweaking that.

## How To

The **How To** section of the docs has a number of minimal tutorials for common scenarios. If you're not sure how to achieve something with Crowds try searching through these guides to see if one explains how to do what you want. If there isn't a suitable guide then come and ask for help on [Discord](https://placeholder.software/discord).
