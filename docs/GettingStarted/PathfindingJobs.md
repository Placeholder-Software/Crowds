## Pathfinding Jobs

Pathfinding can be a very slow operation if the scene is complex or the path is very long. It should not normally be run on the main thread to avoid low frame rates. The basic Unity `NavMeshAgent` calculates paths in a job sometimes (e.g. when using `destination`) but makes it impossible to calculate paths for other purposes in jobs (e.g. when using `CalculatePath`). Overcrowded solves this by calculating all paths in the Unity Job System which this spreads the work over multiple frames and all of the available CPU cores; with this **pathfinding will never cause your game to stutter**!

The pathfinding system built into Overcrowded is based on the [Unity NavMesh](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/nav-NavigationSystem.html) and internally uses the normal Unity pathfinding algorithm. This makes it very easy to move from a Unity `NavMeshAgent` to an Overcrowded `Navigator`. See [this guide](../HowTo/ReplaceNavMeshAgent.md) for how to migrate from a Unity `NavMeshAgent` to an overcrowded `EnhanceNavMeshAgent`.
