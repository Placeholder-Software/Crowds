## Steering Behaviours

Steering behaviours are a way of breaking down the complex job of steering an agent step-by-step through an environment. They were [originally designed by Craig Reynolds](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/) in 1999. Steering behaviours each individually perform a single very simple type of movement, for example:

 - [**Arrive**](../../Reference/MonoBehaviours/Steering/SteerForArrival) at a position.
 - [**Flee**](../../Reference/MonoBehaviours/Steering/SteerForFlee) away from a position.
 - [**Pursue**](../../Reference/MonoBehaviours/Steering/SteerForPursue) a moving target by predicting it's movements.
 - [**Evade**](../../Reference/MonoBehaviours/Steering/SteerForEvade) a moving target by predicting it's movements.
 - [**Wander**](../../Reference/Monobehaviours/Steering/SteerForWander) randomly around.
 - [**Follow**](../../Reference/MonoBehaviours/Steering/SteerForGoal) a path generated by pathfinding.

An agent will often have several of these behaviours which are blended together to form more complex and natural movements.

### Multiple Steering Behaviours

In Crowds, each type of steering behaviour is represented by a MonoBehaviour. In some cases you may want several of the same steering behaviour attached to a single Agent (e.g. _Flee_ from 2 things simultaneously), but Unity does not allow multiple copies of the same component. To solve this problem the Crowds steering MonoBehaviours can each represent several copies of the same steering action:

This `SteerForFlee` inspector shows two flee actions named `FleeOne` and `FleeTwo` fleeing from two different points.

### Context Aware Steering Behaviours

Basic steering behaviours as described above have been used in many games over the years. However they have a serious problem: if two steering behaviours point in opposite directions they will cancel out and the agent will not move! This can result in agents appearing indecisive as they stay around the midpoint or very slowly move to one side. A real person would make a decision and go to one of the two locations.

Crowds solves this problem with "Context Aware Steering behaviours". Each steering behaviour outputs how much it wants to move in a direction and then a final decision is made by finding the most desirable direction to move in. This means that you can add any numbers of steering behaviours to influence the behaviour of an agent in many ways and the agent will still be decisive.

For the above example the steering behaviours would output that they want to move left and move right:

The final decision picks the best direction - in this case because it's a tie an arbitrary decision is made. This is much more realistic than taking the average direction; a person who wants to walk to two locations won't move towards the midpoint they will instead walk to one and then the other.

The steering context is not just used for steering behaviours (deciding where to go) but can also be used for steering sensors (deciding where **not** to go). This can be used to inject gameplay considerations into the movement system, making it appear as if agents are aware of the scene and avoiding enemies/dangers.
