# Overcrowded

Overcrowded **turbocharges** the NPCs in your game! Easily control **large groups** of agents as they move around the scene following paths, marching in formations or wandering about all while **naturally avoiding collisions** with other agents. Bring life to your scene by adding hundreds of agents to the world and leave them to move around the scene naturally or carefully control their movements to drive gameplay.

Overcrowded is built with the Unity Entity Component System (ECS) and the Job system which makes it **fast** and **scalable**. If your game isn't using these things that's not a problem - it's all accessed through **easy to use** MonoBehaviours and a comprehensive scripting API. You can get the **great performance** of ECS for your game without having to learn the complexity of how it works!
