# Crowds

Crowds is a **Path Following** asset for Unity.

Crowds makes it easy to control large groups of agents as they move around the scene, following paths, naturally avoiding collisions other agents and obstacles. Agents can be left to roam freely around the scene to bring life to large populated area or moved in strict formations to drive gameplay.

Crowds is implemented using the Unity Entity Component System (ECS) and the Job system which makes it fast and scalable. If your game isn't using these things that's not a problem - Crowds provides an easy scripting API based on Monobehaviours so you can get the great performance of ECS for your agents without having to learn the complexity of how it works!
