# How To Follow A Path

1. To use pathfinding you must check `Enable Pathing` on the `Navigator` behaviour.
2. Add a `Steer For Goal` behaviour to the agent.
3. Set a destination. To do this you can either:
    - Set the `GoalPosition` on the `Navigator` behaviour from a script.
    - todo (some kind of goal setter with a transform)
